    <h2>About my career</h2>
    <h3>Computer Sciences</h3>
    <p>Computer science is the study of processes that interact with data and that can be represented as data in the form of programs. It enables the use of algorithms to manipulate, store, and communicate digital information. A computer scientist studies the theory of computation and the practice of designing software systems.

    Its fields can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines. Computational complexity theory is highly abstract, while computer graphics emphasizes real-world applications. Programming language theory considers approaches to the description of computational processes, while computer programming itself involves the use of programming languages and complex systems. Humanâ€“computer interaction considers the challenges in making computers useful, usable, and accessible. </p>

    <h4>My career path</h4>
    <p>I am looking forward to be a Data scientist.</p>
    <p>Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.Data science is the same concept as data mining and big data: "use the most powerful hardware, the most powerful programming systems, and the most efficient algorithms to solve problems".

    Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and information science.</p>

    <h2>Professional qualifications after finishing the degree</h2>
    <main>
    <p>The required skills and qualifications for working as a Computer or Software Engineer comprise a large number of theoretical aspects within the areas of Computer Science and Electronics. The following list shows a classification according to the professional profiles that are currently demanded:</p>

    <ul><li>Knowledge of, at least, one programming language (currently in use) or a specific technology in depth.</li>
    <li>Being able to read English, since most of the documents relating to the areas of work as a computer engineer are written in this language.</li>
    <li>Handling of version control systems. Although this is not mandatory, most companies employing computer engineers make use of version control systems.<li>
    Knowledge related to Information Theory and Telecommunications, enabling optimised and legally-compliant designs and facilitating self-control and audits if required.</li>
    <li>Computability Theory to calculate the viability of the problem to be solved.</li>
    <li>Efficiency awareness for industrial mechanization of information (scalability, reliability, etc ...).</li>
    <li>Automata Theory and Algorithm Design Theory to design suitable automation solutions in information processing.</li>
    <li>Software Engineering understanding to evaluate the best techniques of design, development and maintenance of software, subject to calculations of quality constraints, time, cost, etc..</li>
    <li>Artificial Intelligence or Knowledge Engineering such as pattern recognition or neural networks to calculate and design knowledge production systems as an industrial competitive advantage in information management.</li>
    <li>Electronics to calculate and design communication and control interfaces between computers and various mechanical and electrical devices, such as data acquisition systems.</li>
    <li>Management of ICT departments.</li></ul>
