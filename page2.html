  <h1>Who is Sipokazi Makeleni</h1>
  <p>Sipokazi is an enthusiastic and determined human being, who believes in herself and her worth.<br>
  I believe that there is no shortcut to success so whatever challenge i come  across is paving a way for me to success.<br>
  I am determined to make my own future as i vision  it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <p>If there's is anyone who is interested in what i do or sees me
    as their role model,<br> i never discourage them because of the difficulties that i face instead i encourage them to do
    better than me.<br>
    I also believe that when we are holding hand we are much stronger and can do more</p>

  <div class="column">
  <p>Infuse your life with action.<br> Don't wait for it to happen.<br> Make it happen. 
  Make your own future.<br> Make your own hope. Make your own love.<br> And whatever your beliefs, 
  honor your creator, <br>not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high,<br> 
  but by doing what you can to make grace happen... yourself,<br> right now, right down here on Earth.
